A very simple note taking 'app'.
All paths are hard-coded and I call some very ugly shell commands via python.
Sue me.

== Usage
`rofi-notes.py`:: Opens a dmenu (rofi in this case) that lists the names of all notes. When you select a note it is opened in vim. When you type in a note that doesn't exist, it creates a new one.

`rofi-notes.py grep`:: Searches the contents of all notes for your input and then presents a list of results in a dmenu. When you chose one, vim is opened at the specific line.

 `rofi-notes.py pdf`:: Converts selected note to a pdf via ascidoc and opens it in mupdf.
